# Livestock-Track-System
Here is the full-stack project I have completed as my graduation project for the METU IT certificate program. 
This project aimed to achieve  objectives such as user registration, maintaining a database of farm animals, tracking vaccinations, 
and creating veterinary appointments. During the development of this project, we followed the standard software development steps, including analysis, design,
implementation, and testing.
The technologies used in this project are as follows:
